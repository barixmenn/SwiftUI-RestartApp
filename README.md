 ## About the project
    * ADVANCED APPLICATION DESIGN
    - The main purpose of this mini-project is to inspire you on what we can achieve with the SwiftUI framework.
    
    * COMPLEX SWIFTUI MOVEMENTS 
    - We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we cannot find in Apple's stock UI library.
    
    * PARALLAX EFFECT
    - We can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen by using multiple gestures in reverse direction (parallax effect).
